**New website for boridolls.com**

- for English speaking people interested in hand-made, unique felt dolls made with natural materials
- this is a portfolio-like website with the option to by the dolls through the Etsy webshop.

**Brief**

- The reason the old website is being updated is to generate more sales for the Bori Dolls, both online and in various galleries. Therefore the web shop and the presentation of the artworks are almost equally important.
- The costumers are mainly modern but environmental-friendly women (likely mothers) with disposable income, who are interest in natural, organic, hand-made products and art.
- The audience will most likely use desktop computers and phones, browsing the products on the go or at home between two tasks and make the purchases either on desktop computers or phones.
- The website has to be simple and responsive, with emphasis on the artwork with fine, gentle background images and earthy colors. 
- The visitors should not be distracted by fast moving, automated actions, but it could have text fade-ins, background “tricks”, etc.
- The shopping experience has to be simple and self explanatory, delivered with overlays that close on obvious buttons.
- A relatively good example for the structure is http://www.simplygum.com/, but instead of a white background and crisp sharp images we want to use images/material patterns/the artist’s sketches.
- The artist owns the boridolls.com domain.
- The website will be promoted on Facebook, on flyers at galleries and through the mailing list of previous costumers and new subscribers on the new website.

**Technical overview**

- hosting: to be specified
- The design will use some Bootstrap elements (grid, responsive images, navigation, etc) with custom CSS and JS from other developers
- The website will require the custom implementation and use of the Etsy API (https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation)
- The visitors will be able to sign up for a mailing list (Mailchimp or Etsy).
- The testing – after validations and linting - will have to be mostly manual, except for the design that besides being tested on different devices (desktop, ipad, android tablet, smart phones) can be tested with the chrome Developers Tools emulation service.

**Project overview**

- There will be two people working on the project (the artist herself and a web designer), with the optional assistance of a JS developer and a graphic designer with strong typography skills.
- The first viable product is a responsive website with an image gallery  and the integration of the Etsy shop of all Bori Dolls on one page, the deadline is December 13th.
- The final goal is to integrate the Etsy APi in the website, so the artworks can be listed by categories and one by one.
- The budget for the project is very limited, the use of free services and open source solutions are preferred.
